/**
 * Represents a session lease between a client and the Atoma coordination service.
 *
 * <p>A {@code Lease} is fundamental for the secure and reliable operation of all distributed
 * primitives. It maintains its validity through an automatic renewal mechanism. In the event of a
 * client failure, the lease mechanism ensures that any resources held by the client (such as locks)
 * are eventually and automatically reclaimed by the system, thereby preventing deadlocks and
 * resource leaks.
 *
 * <p>This abstract class implements {@link AutoCloseable}, making it suitable for use in
 * try-with-resources statements. This ensures that the lease is cleanly and automatically revoked
 * when the client's scope exits, promoting proper resource management.
