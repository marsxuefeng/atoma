/**
 * The default client-side implementation of a distributed {@link CyclicBarrier}.
 *
 * <p>This class provides a distributed synchronization aid that allows a set of processes and
 * threads to all wait for each other to reach a common barrier point. The barrier is "cyclic"
 * because it can be reused after the waiting threads are released.
 *
 * <h3>Implementation Overview</h3>
 *
 * <p>This implementation coordinates state via a backend {@link CoordinationStore}. The core logic
 * of the {@link #await()} method is divided into two distinct phases to ensure correctness under
 * high concurrency.
 *
 * <ol>
 *   <li><b>Command Phase:</b> When a thread calls {@code await()}, the client first enters a
 *       spin-loop, repeatedly sending an {@code Await} command to the coordination store. The
 *       backend command handler uses optimistic locking to atomically register the participant. The
 *       client continues sending the command until the backend confirms successful registration for
 *       the current barrier generation. This phase robustly handles the race conditions of many
 *       clients trying to arrive at the barrier simultaneously.
 *   <li><b>Local Waiting Phase:</b> Once participation is confirmed by the backend, the thread
 *       waits locally on a {@link java.util.concurrent.locks.Condition}. It remains in this waiting
 *       state until notified of a change in the barrier's generation.
 * </ol>
 *
 * <h4>State Tracking and Wake-up Mechanism</h4>
 *
 * <p>The client subscribes to changes on the barrier's state in the coordination store. When the
 * final participant arrives at the barrier, the backend command "trips" it by incrementing a global
 * {@code generation} number. The client's subscription listener detects this change, compares it to
 * its cached generation value, and if the remote generation is newer, it signals the local
 * condition, waking up all waiting threads.
 *
 * <p>If a thread's wait times out, it assumes responsibility for breaking the barrier for all other
 * participants by issuing a {@link #reset()} command.
 *
 * <p><b>Resource Management:</b> This class implements {@link AutoCloseable}. It is crucial to
 * close the barrier instance (e.g., using a try-with-resources block) to release the underlying
 * network subscription and prevent resource leaks.

   * listen for changes to the barrier's state.
